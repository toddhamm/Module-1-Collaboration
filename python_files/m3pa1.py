# 7.4 Make a list called things with these three strings as elements: "mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella".
things = ["mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"]

# 7.5 Capitalize the element in things that refers to a person and then print the list. Did it change the element in the list?
# things[1].capitalize()
things[1] = things[1].capitalize()
print(things)
# Did it change the element in the list?
# Yes; it is capitalized as the printed output shows: ['mozzarella', 'Cinderella', 'salmonella']

# 7.6 Make the cheesy element of things all uppercase and then print the list.
things[0] = things[0].upper()
print(things)
# output: ['MOZZARELLA', 'Cinderella', 'salmonella']

# 7.7 Delete the disease element from things, collect your Nobel Prize, and print the list.
del things[2]
print(things)
# ['MOZZARELLA', 'Cinderella']

# 9.1 Define a function called good() that returns the following list: ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione'].
def good():
	l = ['Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione']
	return l

print(good())

# 9.2 Define a generator function called get_odds() that returns the odd numbers from range(10). Use a for loop to find and print the third value returned.
def get_odds():
	odd_nums = []
	for num in range(1, 11, 2):
		odd_nums.append(num)
	return odd_nums

nums = get_odds()
# print(test)
x = 1
for num in nums:
	if x == 3:
		print(num)
	x = x + 1
